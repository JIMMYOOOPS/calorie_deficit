## Calorie Deficit API
This is a simple REST API built with Go that allows users to track their calorie intake and expenditure. The API provides endpoints for managing user profiles, logging food intake, and tracking exercise.

### Next Steps for Development
- Health Check Endpoint: Implement a health check endpoint to verify the API status and Database Connection.
- Logging: Integrate a logging library to log requests and errors.
